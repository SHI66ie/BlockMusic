# üîê Backend Wallet Setup for Blockchain Updates

## Overview

The Cloudflare Worker needs a backend wallet to pay gas fees when updating play counts on the blockchain every hour.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES

1. **Create a NEW wallet** - Don't use your personal wallet
2. **Only fund with small amounts** - Just enough for gas fees
3. **Never share the private key** - It's stored as a Cloudflare secret

---

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create a New Wallet

You can use MetaMask or any wallet to generate a new address:

1. **Option A: MetaMask**
   - Open MetaMask
   - Click account icon ‚Üí "Add account or hardware wallet" ‚Üí "Add a new account"
   - Name it "BlockMusic Backend"
   - Copy the address

2. **Option B: Command Line (ethers.js)**
   ```bash
   node -e "const ethers = require('ethers'); const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom(); console.log('Address:', wallet.address); console.log('Private Key:', wallet.privateKey);"
   ```

**Save the private key securely!** You'll need it in Step 3.

### Step 2: Fund the Wallet

The backend wallet needs ETH on **Base Sepolia** to pay for gas fees.

**Estimated Costs:**
- Gas per update: ~0.0001 ETH
- Updates per hour: 1-10 tracks
- Monthly cost: ~0.01-0.1 ETH (~$20-200 at current prices)

**Get Test ETH:**

1. **Base Sepolia Faucet:**
   - Go to: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet
   - Enter your backend wallet address
   - Request testnet ETH

2. **Alternative Faucets:**
   - https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia
   - https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia

**Recommended:** Start with 0.1 ETH (testnet) to cover ~1000 updates.

### Step 3: Set the Private Key as a Cloudflare Secret

**NEVER put the private key in `wrangler.toml` or commit it to git!**

Use Cloudflare's secret management:

```bash
cd cloudflare-worker

# Set the secret (you'll be prompted to paste the private key)
wrangler secret put BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY
```

**When prompted, paste your private key** (starts with `0x...`)

**Verify it's set:**
```bash
wrangler secret list
```

You should see:
```
BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY (set)
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Worker

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

The worker will now be able to update the blockchain!

## üß™ Testing the Blockchain Updates

### Test 1: Manual Cron Trigger

You can manually trigger the cron job to test it:

```bash
# Watch the logs
wrangler tail

# In another terminal, trigger the cron
curl -X POST "https://blockmusic-play-tracker.blockmusic.workers.dev/__scheduled?cron=0+*+*+*+*"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting batch blockchain update...
Processing 1 track updates: [{tokenId: 0, plays: 1}]
Updating blockchain with backend wallet: 0x...
Updating token 0 with 1 plays...
Transaction sent: 0x...
Transaction confirmed in block 12345
‚úÖ All blockchain updates successful!
Pending counts cleared
Batch update complete
```

### Test 2: Wait for Hourly Cron

The cron runs every hour at minute 0 (e.g., 1:00, 2:00, 3:00).

**To monitor:**
```bash
wrangler tail
```

**Wait for the next hour**, and you should see the batch update logs.

### Test 3: Verify Blockchain Update

After a successful update, check the blockchain:

1. **Via Contract:**
   - Go to Base Sepolia Explorer
   - Search for your MusicNFT contract: `0x8F046B35163A821204B3a42C1E94B0Bc69BFDe37`
   - Look for recent `incrementPlayCount` transactions

2. **Via Frontend:**
   - Go to Artist Dashboard
   - Refresh the page
   - Play counts should now show the confirmed plays (no longer pending)

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Backend Wallet Balance

```bash
# Using cast (from Foundry)
cast balance 0xYOUR_BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org

# Or check on Base Sepolia Explorer
# https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xYOUR_BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Refill When Low

When balance drops below 0.01 ETH, refill from faucet or send more ETH.

### View Logs

```bash
# Real-time logs
wrangler tail

# Or view in Cloudflare Dashboard
# https://dash.cloudflare.com ‚Üí Workers & Pages ‚Üí blockmusic-play-tracker ‚Üí Logs
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Error: "BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY not set"

**Solution:**
```bash
wrangler secret put BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY
# Paste your private key when prompted
wrangler deploy
```

### Error: "Insufficient funds for gas"

**Solution:**
- Check wallet balance
- Fund with more ETH from faucet
- Verify you're on Base Sepolia network

### Error: "Transaction reverted"

**Possible causes:**
1. Contract doesn't have `incrementPlayCount` function
2. Backend wallet doesn't have permission
3. Token ID doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Check contract ABI matches
- Verify backend wallet has correct permissions
- Check logs for specific error message

### Updates Not Happening

**Check:**
1. Cron is configured: `wrangler.toml` has `crons = ["0 * * * *"]`
2. Secret is set: `wrangler secret list`
3. Wallet has funds: Check balance
4. Logs show activity: `wrangler tail`

## üìä Cost Estimation

### Testnet (Base Sepolia)
- **Cost:** FREE (testnet ETH from faucets)
- **Frequency:** Hourly
- **Gas per update:** ~21,000 gas √ó tracks
- **Monthly:** 0 cost (using testnet)

### Mainnet (Base)
- **Gas Price:** ~0.001 Gwei (Base is very cheap)
- **Cost per update:** ~$0.001-0.01
- **Hourly updates:** ~$0.01-0.10/hour
- **Monthly:** ~$7-72/month

**Optimization:** Batch multiple tracks in one transaction to save gas.

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ **Use a dedicated backend wallet** - Not your personal wallet
2. ‚úÖ **Store private key as Cloudflare secret** - Never in code
3. ‚úÖ **Fund with minimal amounts** - Only what's needed
4. ‚úÖ **Monitor balance regularly** - Set up alerts
5. ‚úÖ **Rotate keys periodically** - Every 3-6 months
6. ‚úÖ **Limit contract permissions** - Only allow incrementPlayCount

## üìù Summary

**What you did:**
1. ‚úÖ Created backend wallet
2. ‚úÖ Funded with testnet ETH
3. ‚úÖ Set private key as Cloudflare secret
4. ‚úÖ Deployed worker with blockchain update capability

**What happens now:**
1. Users play tracks ‚Üí Recorded in Cloudflare
2. Every hour ‚Üí Cron job runs
3. Backend wallet ‚Üí Updates blockchain with play counts
4. Artists ‚Üí See updated play counts and revenue
5. Artists ‚Üí Can claim their earnings!

**Next steps:**
- Test the cron job manually
- Monitor the first few hourly updates
- Verify artists see revenue
- Set up balance monitoring

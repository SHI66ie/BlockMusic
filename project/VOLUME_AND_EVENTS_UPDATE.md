# Volume Control & Events Update

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed Volume Control

**Problem:** Volume control wasn't working properly - mute/unmute functionality was broken and visual feedback was missing.

**Solution:**
- **AudioPlayer.tsx**: Fixed `toggleMute()` function to properly restore volume when unmuting
- **AudioPlayer.tsx**: Added visual gradient to volume slider showing current volume level
- **NowPlayingBar.tsx**: Added visual gradient to volume slider for better UX

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Before: Volume wasn't restored properly
if (isMuted) {
  audio.volume = volume || 0.5;
  setIsMuted(false);
}

// After: Volume state is properly managed
if (isMuted) {
  const newVolume = volume > 0 ? volume : 0.5;
  audio.volume = newVolume;
  setVolume(newVolume);  // ✅ Update state
  setIsMuted(false);
}
```

**Visual Improvements:**
- Volume sliders now show purple gradient indicating current volume level
- Consistent styling across AudioPlayer and NowPlayingBar components

### 2. ✅ Changed "Concerts" to "Events"

**Reason:** More inclusive terminology that covers all types of artist events, not just concerts.

**Files Updated:**
- `src/pages/Artist.tsx` - All references updated
- `src/components/subscription/SubscriptionPlans.tsx` - Feature description updated

**Changes:**
- Interface renamed: `Concert` → `Event`
- State variable: `concerts` → `events`
- Function: `setConcerts` → `setEvents`
- Revenue calculation: `concertRevenue` → `eventRevenue`
- Tab name: "Concerts" → "Events"
- UI labels: "Upcoming Concerts" → "Upcoming Events"
- Button text: "Add Concert" → "Add Event"
- Subscription feature: "Early access to concerts" → "Early access to events"

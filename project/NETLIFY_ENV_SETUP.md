## Complete Environment Variables List for Netlify

Here's the complete list of blockchain-related variables you should have:

```bash
# Revenue Distribution System (NEW)
VITE_REVENUE_DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT=0xa61eAfed9c3B7cF6575FB7E35E18ABe425306f02

# Subscription Contracts
VITE_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT=0x4371eE0797e2590d2650395FDc8666795DceB92A
VITE_ETH_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT=0x1d336b8cCA220d596f0e2Fd368fa2424dcbB987A

VITE_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

# WalletConnect (if you have this)

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Why This Is Critical:
- ‚ùå **Without updating:** Your production site will use the OLD subscription contract
- ‚ùå **Old contract:** Sends 100% to platform wallet (no artist payments)
- ‚úÖ **New contract:** Properly splits 85% to artists, 15% to platform

### What Happens After Update:
- ‚úÖ New subscriptions will use the revenue distribution system
- ‚úÖ Artists can claim their 85% share
- ‚úÖ Platform receives correct 15% fee
- ‚úÖ All revenue is tracked on-chain

### Testing After Deployment:
1. Visit your production site
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check that contract addresses match:
   ```javascript
   console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_REVENUE_DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT);
   console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT);
   ```
4. Test a subscription purchase
5. Verify on Basescan that revenue split is correct

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Added `VITE_REVENUE_DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT` to Netlify
- [ ] Updated `VITE_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT` to new address

- [ ] Checked deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Visited production site and verified it loads
- [ ] Tested subscription flow on production
- [ ] Verified artist can see claimable revenue
- [ ] Checked Basescan for correct revenue split

## Troubleshooting

### If production site shows errors:

2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure no typos in contract addresses
4. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### If subscriptions don't work:

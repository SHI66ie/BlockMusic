## üîß Current Implementation Details

### Subscription Context (`SubscriptionContext.tsx`):

**Key Functions:**
- ‚úÖ `checkSubscription()` - Checks both USDC and ETH subscriptions
- ‚úÖ `handleSubscribe()` - Processes payments (ETH or USDC)
- ‚úÖ `refreshSubscription()` - Manually refresh subscription status

**Payment Logic:**
```typescript
// ETH Payment
- Calculate ETH amount from USD price (assumes 1 ETH = $2000)
- Single transaction: subscribeWithETH(plan)
- Value sent: calculated ETH amount

// USDC Payment
- Calculate USDC amount (1 USDC = $1)
- Transaction 1: approve(subscriptionContract, amount)
- Transaction 2: subscribe(plan)
```

**Subscription Check:**
```typescript
// Checks both contracts
const isActive = usdcSubscribed || ethSubscribed;
// User is subscribed if either is true
```

- **Implementation:** `0xE3C8779cCBc4742bf35809Ab584FB5F182266696`

### 3. **Updated Cloudflare Worker**

- ✅ Deployed worker with new configuration

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update Frontend

You need to update the frontend `.env` file with the new contract address:

### Update `project/.env`:

```bash
VITE_MUSIC_NFT_CONTRACT=0x47991c5D3bb51972Bef2075cAE9E7bFa08D17817
```

### Then redeploy to Netlify:

```bash
cd project
git add .env
git commit -m "Update MusicNFT contract address"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically redeploy.

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 1. Mint a New NFT

Since this is a new contract, you need to mint NFTs on the new contract:

1. Go to: https://blockmusic.netlify.app
2. Connect wallet
3. Go to Artist Dashboard
4. Upload a track and mint NFT

### 2. Test Play Tracking

```bash
# Play a track on the website
# Then check Cloudflare stats
curl https://blockmusic-play-tracker.blockmusic.workers.dev/api/stats
```

### 3. Trigger Blockchain Sync

```bash
# Manual trigger
curl -X POST https://blockmusic-play-tracker.blockmusic.workers.dev/api/trigger-sync

# Or wait for hourly cron (runs at :00 every hour)
```

### 4. Verify Blockchain Update

```bash
cd cloudflare-worker
node check-correct-contract.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Token 0 exists!
Play Count: 1 (or more)
```

## 📊 System Architecture

```
User Plays Track
    ↓
Cloudflare Worker Records Play
    ↓
Every Hour: Cron Job
    ↓
Backend Wallet (0xb89A...3764)
Calls incrementPlayCount()
    ↓
New Upgradeable Contract (0x4799...7817)
Updates play count on blockchain
    ↓
Artist Dashboard Shows Revenue
    ↓
Artist Claims Payment 💰
```

## 🔄 Contract Upgrade Process (Future)

Since the contract is now upgradeable, you can add new features without redeploying:

```bash
# 1. Update contracts/MusicNFT.sol with new features
# 2. Compile
npx hardhat compile

# 3. Create upgrade script
# scripts/upgrade-to-v3.js

# 4. Run upgrade
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-to-v3.js --network baseSepolia
```

The proxy address stays the same, only the implementation changes!

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Old vs New Contract:

**Old Contract (`0x0192...BDFA`):**
- ❌ No `incrementPlayCount()` function
- ❌ Not upgradeable
- ❌ NFTs won't work with new system
- ⚠️ Deprecated - don't use

**New Contract (`0x4799...7817`):**
- ✅ Has `incrementPlayCount()` function
- ✅ Upgradeable (UUPS proxy)
- ✅ Works with subscription system

### Migration:

**NFTs from the old contract will NOT automatically transfer.**

Options:
1. **Recommended:** Mint new NFTs on the new contract
2. **Advanced:** Create a migration script (complex)
